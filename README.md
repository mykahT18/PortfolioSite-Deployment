### This codebase is focusing on Setting up a server and installing Wordpress on that server. We will also cover the local installation and SCP (Secure Copy Protocol).

##Local Installation
####Things you need to have:
1. Create a folder on your local machine: 
	* `$ cd ~/Desktop`
	* `$ mkdir wp-setup && cd wp-setup`
2. Download File from repo (Top right corner button).
3. Unzip the file and place it file into `wp-setup`.


The reason why we are creating this folder is to setup the environment you will be working in.
